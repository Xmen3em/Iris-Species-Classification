1. There are no missing values and there are 3 duplicate values which I remove

2. There is one classification column (target) and it is handled by the map function

3. From the correlation matrix we see that the target category column has a very positive correlation with sepal_width and a very negative correlation with
     Sepal length, petal length, and petal width

4. From the distribution graph we see that the bars are normally distributed

5. There are some outliers in the petal_width feature and I removed them

6. We select all columns while applying feature selection by ANOVA test and before we see the relationship between independent and dependent feature is highly correlated

7. We apply standardization on independent features to logistic regression modeling, SVM, and K-NN models

8. We implemented RepeatedStratifiedKFold and cross_val_score to avoid over-fitting the data

9. Logistic regression is the best model with a cross_val_score of 96.5%

10. I do not see that challenges in this project are difficult
